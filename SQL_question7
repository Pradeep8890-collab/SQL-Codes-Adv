Write a SQL query to find the maximum gap or window period in order of a particular product in a particular period of time year or month.
Note - You can use your own period as per desired result

use AdventureWorksDW2022
; with CTE1 as -- filter the period you are interested to display the result
(
select
ProductKey,
datetrunc(DAY,orderdate) as dt,
year(orderdate) as yr,
datename(month,orderdate) as mth,
SalesAmount
from FactInternetSales
where year(OrderDate) = '2014'
), CTE2 as -- use lead function to calcualte the date difference or gap
(
select
ProductKey,
dt,
lead(dt,1,dt) over(partition by productkey order by dt) as ld_dt -- you can choose any other value for the Null results
from
CTE1
), CTE3 as -- calculating date difference
(
select
*,
DATEDIFF(day,dt,ld_dt) as dt_df 
from
CTE2
)
select * from
(select
*,
rank() over(partition by productkey order by dt_df desc) as rnk --rank the date difference
from
CTE3) sq1
where rnk =1
